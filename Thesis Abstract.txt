Title: Point descriptors in morphological analysis of three-dimensional face images

The dissertation presents a system prepared to automatically analyse three-dimensional
face scans. Its design and implementation process is described. The system allows for face
and nose localization in source cloud of points. Its functionality also includes identification
of characteristic points on nose.

In theoretical introduction a review of known methods of free-form objects analysis is
presented. An approach based on point descriptors is explained. Basing on its computational
and algorithmic features the choice of this technique is clarified. Selection of sources is
motivated. Measurement data characteristics are presented.

The practical part describes the design and implementation of proposed system. In the
first phase source data is filtered and preprocessed. Algorithms used for normal vectors estimation
and descriptors calculations are explained. Innovative procedure of hierarchical region
localisation is presented. The process of face, nose and characteristic points identification,
based on this procedure is revealed. Each element of the system was tested. Results are
discussed and interpreted.

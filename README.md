3d-img-face-analysis
====================

The system is prepared to automatically analyse three-dimensional (e.g. face) scans (x,y,z clouds of points). The system functionality includes identification of characteristic points. An approach based on point descriptors is used. In the first phase source data is filtered and preprocessed. Algorithms used for normal vectors estimation
and descriptors calculations are used. Then innovative procedure of hierarchical region localisation is applied. 

The system provides following functionality:
 - preprocessing, filtering and smoothing
 - normal vectors calculation
 - point descriptors calculation
 - subregions (e.g. face and nose ) localization 
 - and more

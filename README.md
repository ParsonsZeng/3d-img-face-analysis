3d-img-face-analysis
====================

The system is prepared to automatically analyse three-dimensional (e.g. face) scans (x,y,z clouds of points). 
It provides following functionality:
 - preprocessing, filtering and smoothing
 - normal vectors calculation
 - point descriptors calculation
 - subregions (e.g. face and nose ) localization
